## Executive Summary
In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis to determine the pricing of rocket launch based on the reusability of the first stage of launch. The analysis is based on the history of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launches. The methodologies employed can be summarized as follows: ​

Data Gathering – We gathered extensive public information about SpaceX, including historical rocket launch data, mission parameters, payload details, and outcomes of previous launches. ​

Machine Learning Model – to predict the reusability of Falcon 9's first stage, we developed a machine learning model. This model was trained on a diverse dataset that included mission-specific variables and historical success rates. ​

The analysis yielded noteworthy results. The machine learning model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the recoverability of the first stage, providing Space Y with a valuable tool for competitive strategy. ​

​## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of space exploration and commercialization, our project stands at the intersection of innovation and competition. The commercial space age has dawned, and companies like SpaceX have made space travel more accessible than ever before. As we embark on this endeavor, it's essential to understand the dynamic context that has shaped our mission. ​

SpaceX, under the visionary leadership of Elon Musk, has achieved remarkable feats, from sending spacecraft to the International Space Station to establishing the revolutionary Starlink satellite internet constellation. Their cost-effective approach to space launches, epitomized by the Falcon 9 rocket, has disrupted the industry. SpaceX's ability to recover and reuse the first stage of their rockets has been a game-changer, significantly reducing launch costs. ​

However, in the midst of this competition, Space Y, a new entrant into the market, seeks to challenge SpaceX's dominance. To do so, we must delve into the heart of the matter. Our project seeks to answer crucial questions: What drives the pricing of space launches, and how can we offer competitive pricing? Can we predict the reusability of the first stage, allowing for strategic decisions? These questions are central to our mission, and as data scientists, our task is to leverage data, methodologies, and insights to provide solutions that propel Space Y into the forefront of the commercial space launch industry.​
